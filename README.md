# Geldium Delinquency Risk EDA

## üìä Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Geldium‚Äôs customer credit dataset to assist **Tata iQ's analytics team** in refining their **delinquency risk prediction model**. The analysis aims to uncover missing data issues, detect early risk factors, and ensure data readiness for predictive modeling.

## üß† Key Steps Performed

1. **Dataset Review**  
   - Checked data structure, types, and key variables  
   - Identified missing values and inconsistencies

2. **Missing Data Treatment**  
   - Imputed missing values for `Income`, `Credit_Score`, and `Loan_Balance`  
   - Chose imputation methods (mean/median) based on data type and business relevance

3. **Pattern Detection & Risk Indicators**  
   - Explored correlation between variables and delinquency  
   - Identified high-risk features like `Missed_Payments`, `Credit_Utilization`, and `Debt_to_Income_Ratio`

4. **AI & GenAI Support**  
   - Used AI tools to guide imputation strategy, detect anomalies, and identify predictive variables

## üîç Insights & Recommendations

- Strong predictors of delinquency include:
  - High number of missed payments
  - High credit utilization rate
  - Low credit score
  - High debt-to-income ratio

- Next Steps:
  - Use cleaned dataset to build classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
  - Perform feature engineering on `Month_1` to `Month_6` columns to extract repayment patterns
  - Monitor fairness metrics if synthetic data generation is applied
